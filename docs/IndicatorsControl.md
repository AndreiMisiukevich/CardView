### IndicatorsControl

This is the indicator control, usually displayed as a set of circles(dots) at the bottom of the control.

### Setup

If the IndicatorsControl is nested in a [CarouselView](CarouselView.md) or [CardView](CardView.md) then the following properties are bound to the parent:
- SelectedIndex
- ItemsCount
- IndicatorsContexts
- IsUserInteractionRunning
- IsAutoInteractionRunning
